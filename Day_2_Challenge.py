# Write a Python program that takes as input a pre-formatted string of phrases/sentences mixed with numbers like below:
# What is the main reason for leaving?
# 21
# Happy Easter Holidays
# 40
# All the men here are just not understanding the situation
# Happy Easter Holidays
# 50
# In what ways can I help you
# Happy Easter Holidays
# You better learn how to be polite
# 100
# Happy Easter Holidays
# OMG that food is looking really great
# Happy Easter Holidays
# 100
# 800
# 900
# Well, let us try to think about that in another way
# Notice that 5 lines of the string have the phrase “Happy Easter Holidays” repeated, while there are additional six sentences that are not repeated, as well as numbers inserted on a few lines.
# Your task is to:
# •	Print out the strings like below:
# •	Extract the 5 repeated phrase and print to the terminal
# •	Extract the non-repeated phrase and print to the terminal
# •	Extract all the numbers and print to the terminal
# Note: Make sure you write a pseudocode to capture your thought process before writing any line of code. The pseudocode is also part of the assignment. If any question(s), ask your co-students and if still unresolved, you can ask me.
